# Roadmap
Project Roadmap Markdown Repository.

## What we have to do

- <b> git Tool Study (using github) </b>

> basic understanding of git
> git cli (command line interface)
> critical git commands (add, push, pull, commit, stash ...)

- <b> Basic Server Understanding </b>

> To build well-implemented front-end services, developers should know the basic understandings of server.
> we will implement basic server (detailed feature will be notified)
> server framework will be Nestjs (using Node js)

- <b> Basic Database Understanding </b>

> Server should provided non-volatile data.
> database will provide them.
> using orm & basic query (psql), we will study Database (a little bit) and connect it to our server (Remember Assignment 3)

- <b> Front-end </b>

> This time, we will use react as a front-end framework.
> In the Assignment2, We used Angular framework. That is because Angular Framework is more appropriate for learning the basic structure of front-end web services.
> this time, we will use react framework. which is fast-growing framework (it has virtual dom for fast rendering FYI)

- <b> Now... SNUEV </b>


 Above is the rough roadmap of our team project.
